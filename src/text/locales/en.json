        "description": "Lack of instant transaction notifications is a huge risk. You learn about fund movements only after they occur, when it’s often too late to react. Many companies miss critical information due to the absence of an alerting system. Without a structured process and specialized tools, you can’t monitor fund movements on corporate wallets in real time. This creates a loss of control and increases the consequences of unauthorized operations."

If private keys and signing rights are concentrated in one person’s hands, and there’s no multisig, role separation, or activity auditing, your company faces a massive risk. Without proper storage and recovery policies, vulnerabilities arise that can lead to irreversible losses."
